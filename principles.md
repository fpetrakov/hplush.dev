## We are protecting users from ourselves

For every project, we need to create a **document with all security risks** and how we reduce these risks. This document should cover attacks from:

* **Ourselves.** What if we will start to be an evil company. Especially, the document should cover how we plan to prevent ourselves from being an uncontrollable monopoly.
* **Government and big companies.** Who has access to user data? How we can prevent data leaks.
* **Trolls.** How people can use community rules in destructive form?


## Users-first

* **Users own their data.** They should understand if we use their data for anything. Our architecture should allow them to remove their data or download it.
* We should prefer **[local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html) architecture** where it is possible.
* User should be able to **change client** or move to another vendor.
* UI should explain to users **how everything work**. No magic or black boxes.
* **We do no make decisions for users.** We should explain them consequences and help to make a decision. But in the end, users should feel that they control the system.


## We support diversity, not popular solutions

* We should try to focus on **specific cases** instead of creating a universal system for everything.
* In every app we should care about **i18n**, **cross-platform support**, and **a11y**.
* **There is no single truth.** Freedom is right to be wrong.


## Open by default

* **Monetization model** or plans for monetization on early stages should be open and documented. Security risks document from “We are protecting users from ourselves” is a good place for it.
* We should keep **discussions about the project open**. If it is not possible, at least, we should explain the reasons of our discussions.
* All code should by **open-sources by default**. We should have good reasons if we need to close any component.
* We should **document all protocols** used in an application.
* **We are making mistakes.** We should not be afraid of uncomfortable questions and even promote discussions about our problems. On the other hand, we should not blame anyone from the team for mistakes.
